Question:

Imagine you are tasked with developing a weather monitoring system for a smart home. The system needs to notify various smart devices in the home when the weather conditions change, such as temperature fluctuations, rainfall, or strong winds. Implement the Observer Pattern to design a flexible and scalable solution for this weather monitoring system. Consider the different smart devices (observers) in the home that should be notified when the weather conditions (observable) change. Provide a brief explanation of how your implementation adheres 
to the principles of the Observer Pattern and how it promotes the decoupling of the weather monitoring system components.
